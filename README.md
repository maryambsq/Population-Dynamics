## Introduction
Population Dynamics in India is a comprehensive data analytics project that aims to measure and analyze the population trends in India. Utilizing datasets available from various online sources, this project employs Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data preparation, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The project is structured to include common functions for data handling and specific analyses for total population, gender-wise distribution, and age-wise segmentation.

## Features
- **Common Functions File**: Contains reusable functions for loading, cleaning, and visualizing data.
- **Total Population Analysis**: Analyzes the overall population growth over time.
- **Gender-wise Distribution**: Examines the distribution and trends in male and female populations.
- **Age-wise Segmentation**: Investigates population trends across different age groups (0-14, 15-64, and 65+).

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
