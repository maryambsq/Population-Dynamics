## Introduction
Population Dynamics in India is a comprehensive exploratory data analytics project that aims to measure and analyze the population trends in India. Utilizing datasets available from various online sources, this project uses Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data preparation, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The project is structured to include common functions for data handling processes and specific analyses for total population, gender-wise distribution, and age-wise segmentation.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `common_functions.py`: Contains reusable functions for loading, cleaning, preprocessing and visualizing data.
- `total_population_analysis.py`: Analyzes the overall population growth over time.
- `gender_wise_population_analysis.py`: Examines the distribution and trends in male and female populations.
- `age_wise_population_analysis.py`: Investigates population trends across different age groups (0-14, 15-64, and 65+).
- `datasets/`: Contains the datasets used for analysis.

## Features
- Data Loading: To load datasets for analysis.
- Data Cleaning and Preproccessing: To clean and prepare datasets for analysis.
- Data Visualization: For creating visualizations such as line charts, bar graphs, and pie charts for data insights.


## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
- **VS Code**: The integrated coding and development environment.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.
3. Place the datasets in the `datasets` directory.
4. Run the analysis scripts:
   `total_population_analysis.py`
   `gender_wise_population_analysis.py`
   `age_wise_population_analysis.py`
